# Python Intro

## This course:
### How it works
+ "PythonCode" directory - contains all the files you need to complete this course 
  + "Completed" directory - The examples gone over in this tutorial completed if you get stuck
  + "You Try!" directory - Uncompleted code files that you can use to do this tutorial 
## What each lesson covers:
