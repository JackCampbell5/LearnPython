## In This Lesson
#### Printing
#### Comments
#### Variables 
#### Math


## Part A: Printing 
+ To print all you do is put print("") and whatever you want to print in the ""
+ You can print any type but only one type at once
```python
print("Hello")
```
+ You can use the add to add 2 types of things you are printing 
```python
print("Hello"+" test")
```
+ To print out multiple types quickly you can put a coma and put as many different types as long as they are seperated by commas
```python
print("Hello",10)
```
+ Inside your quotes you can also add \ and then certain characters to do things

| Corrector | What it does          |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| \n        | New Line              |
| \t        | Tab                   |
| \"        | Double Quotation mark |
| \'        | Single Quotation mark |
| \\        | Backslash             |

#### You Try
+ Print out: Hello world
+ Print out: Age: 10
+ Print out: Hello 	 World "Jack"

## Part B: Comments
+ Single line comments are prefaced with #
```python
# Single line comment
```
+ Multi line connects can be stored between 2 sets of '''comment'''
```python
'''Hello
This is a multiline comment
'''
```

#### You Try:
+ Make a Comment in part b that says "This is a Comment"
+ Create a multiline comment that contains your name and todays date

## Part C: Variables:
+ In Python you do not and can not define variables as a specific type
+ They are created with assigning a variable name to a value
+ Unlike in Java different words are seperated by a _ in variable names
+ 5 Basic types


| Type    | What it does                     |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| String  | Stores words and many characters |
| Char    | A single character               |
| Int     | Whole Number                     |
| Float   | Number with decimal              |
| Boolean | A True or False value            |
```python
string_var = "I am a string"
int_var = 10
float_var = 10.1
char_var = 'e'
boolean_var = True
```
+ To print a variable just put it in a print statement
```python
cash = 1000
print("Your Cash: ",cash)
```
+ If you want to change a variable just change the value assigned to it
```python
cash = 990
print("Your Cash: ",cash)
```
### You Try:
+ Create variable for your name and print it 
+ Create a integer value for your rating of this tutorial and print: Stars: 4.5
+ Create a boolean value to false print it, make it true and print it again

## Part D Math:
+ In python, you can add, subtract, divide, modulus, and multiply 
+ You CAN NOT use var++ in python

| Math | What it does                     |
|------|----------------------------------|
| +    | Addition                         |
| -    | Subtraction                      |
| /    | Division                         |
| %    | Get the remainder after division |
| *    | Multiply                         |
```python
var1 = 10+10 # 20
var2 = 10-10 # 0
var3 = 10/10 # 1
var4 = 10%10 # 0
var4a = 11%10 #1
var4b = 5%13 # 3
var5 = 10*10 # 100
```

#### You try:
+ Create a variable for 168 and a variable for 187
+ Adding 168 and 187 and print the result
+ Subtract 168 and 187 and print the result
+ Multiply 168 and 187 and print the result
+ Modulus 168 and 187 and print the result
+ Divide 168 and 187 and print the result
