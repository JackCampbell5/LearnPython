# Part Two

## In This Lesson
#### If statements
#### If else statements
#### For Loops
#### While Loops


## Part A:  
+ If statements are done with just the "if" keyword and a ':' at the end
+ You do not need to have () around a if statement but it will not error
+ You can use the below conditionals to compare

| Condition | What it does             |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| ==        | Equals                   |
| !=        | Not Equals               |
| <         | Less Than                |
| \>        | Greater Than             |
| <=        | Less Than or Equal to    |
| >=        | Greater Than or Equal to |

```python
num = 10
if num == 10:
    print("Hello")
# Will print Hello as num does = 19
```
+ To figure out if a variable is a certain type you can use the is condition
+ When an object has not been initialized the value is None so you can compare to it like a type

```python
# num is initialized to an Integer so checking if it is an integer 
num = 10
if num is int:
    print("Num is an Integer")
```
+ To check 2 conditions you use the and operator by simply typing and
+ If you want to know if 1 var equals 2 things you have to do it independently
+ If you want to check a range of values you can put a value inside < and > sign

```python
num = 30
var = True
if num > 5 and var:
    print("Greater than 5 and True")
if 10 > num > 5:
    print("Num is in the correct range")
```
+ To check 2 conditions you use the or operator by simply typing or
+ This will run if either condition is true and will skip subsequent conditions if the first one is true 

```python
num = 30
var = False
if num > 5 or var:
    print("Greater than 5 and True")
```
+ To check if a boolean is true you can just put if and then the var name
+ TO check if it is not true put not in front of the var name 
```python
var = True
if var:
    print("Var is True")
if not var:
    print("Var is false")
```
#### You Try
+ Create an int value and check if it is equal to its value and print a statement 
+ Create a String value and check if it is a String and print var
